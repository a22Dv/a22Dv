## Hello!

I'm Angelo, I'm currently a 19-year-old 
1st year Computer Science student.

For now, I'm currently working on my own personal projects,
I'm interested in game automation among other things and whatever
piques my interest at the moment.

I spend most of my time around C/C++ as well as Python
as my language of choice.
